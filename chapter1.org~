    basics of networking

** [1.1] Networks connect us 
    Computer networking, including the internet, has impacted how the world works. 
    Individual lifestyles are even affected.
    Physical limitations became less irrelevant.
    
*** [1.1.2]
    - Cisco is founded in 1997
    - Other cisco sht... (including ads)

** [1.2] Network Components
*** [1.2.1] Host Roles
    Global communities are tied by the internet.
    A computer must first be connected to the internet inorder to participate.
    
    Hosts
	- all computers that are connected to a network and participate directly in network communication
	- can also be called 'end devices'
	- some hosts are 'clients'
	- specifically refers to devices on the network that are ASSIGNED A NUMBER for communication purposes.
	  - The number identifies the host within a network
	  - the number is called the Internet Protocol (IP) address

    IP Address
	- Identifies the host and the network to which the host is attached

    Servers
	- are COMPUTERS WITH SOFTWARE that ALLOW THEM TO PROVIDE INFORMATION
	  - Ex. of server software:
	     web server
	     database server

    Clients
	- have software for requesting and displaying information obtained from the server
	  - Ex . of client software
	    Web Browser

    - Types of server software:
      |-------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
      | Type  | Description                                                                                                                                  |
      |-------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
      | Email | runs email server software (microsoft outlook, etx). Used to access email on the server.                                                     |
      | Web   | runs web server software. Used to Access the webpages on the server                                                                          |
      | File  | stores corporate and user files in a central location. Client devices access these files using file explorers such as Windows' File Explorer |

      | TAKEAWAYS                                                                |
      |--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
      | All servers are hosts, but not all hosts are servers (same with clients) |
      |--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
      | There are three types of server software: Email, Web, File               |
      |--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
      | All server software has a (or multiple) pairing client software          |
      |--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
      | Client and server network requires seperate computers for each           |
      |--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
	  
*** [1.2.2] Peer-to-Peer
    Peer-to-peer network is used in small businesses an homes.
    Computers function as SERVERS AND CLIENTS on the network.

    | Advantages of peer-to-peer networking                                  |
    |------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | easy to setup                                                          |
    | less complex                                                           |
    | lower costs since no dedicated servers are required                    |
    | can be used for simple tasks (transferring files and sharing printeres |
    |------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    
    | Disadvantages of peer-to-peer networking                                                       |
    |------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | No centralized administration (no servers to mingle with if you want to control the data etc.) |
    | Not as secure *any computer in the network can access or pretend to be a server                |
    | not scalable                                                                                   |
    | multiple roles in devices may hinder their performance                                         |
    |------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

*** [1.2.3] End Devices
    To distiguish one device from another, end devices are given unique addresses.
    When a device initiates communication, it uses the address of the devices to deliver the message.

*** [1.2.4] Intermediary Devices
    connect the individual end devices to the network.
    they can connect multiple networks together to create an internetwork.
    provides connectivity and ensure that data flows across the network.
    these devices use the device addresses and the information about the internetwork to determine the path the message will take.

    #+NAME: Intermediary Devices
    |--------------------|
    | Wireless router    |
    | LAN switch         |
    | router             |
    | multilayer switch  |
    | firewall appliance |
    |--------------------|
    
*** [1.2.5] Network media
    where communications transmit across
    provides a channel for data to travel from source to destination.

    #+NAME: Primary types of modern network media
    | Name                                  | Types       | Definition                                   |

    |---------------------------------------+-------------+----------------------------------------------|

**** criteria for choosing network media
    price
    distance
    environment to be installed in
    what speed must the data be transmitted

    
** [1.3] Network Representations and Topologies

*** [1.3.1] Network Representations
    (TOPOLOGY diagram)
    are used to represent networks: the components, what the network looks like, where are specific components located.
    provides a way to easily understand how devices connect to a large network

    
**** Additional terminology
    NIC (network interface card)
    - physically connects the end device to the network

    Physical port
    - where the network media connects
    - a connector or outlet

    Interface
    - specialized ports that connect to individual networks
    - because routers connect networks, its ports are called network interfaces.

*** [1.3.2] Topology diagrams
    mandatory diagrams for networks
    a visual map of how networks are connected
    There are two types of diagrams: physical and logical.


    Physical topology diagrams
    illustrate the physical location of intermediary devices and cable installation

    Logical topology diagrams
    illustrate the devices, ports, and the addressing scheme of the network.
    shows which devices are connected to intermediary devices and what network media is used

    

** [1.4] Common types of networks
*** [1.4.1] Networks of many sizes
    internet
    largest network in existence
    means "network of networks"

    | Small Office and Home Office (SOHO) | allows computers in a home or remote office to access corporate resources, or centralized, shared resources     |
    | medium to large networks            | can have many locations with hundreds or thousands of interconnected hosts (used by corporations and companies) |
    | world wide networks                 | network of networks, connects hundreds of millions of computers worldwide                                       |

*** [1.4.2] LANs and WANs
    network infrastuctures vary greatly in terms of:
    1. size of area covered
    2. number of users connected
    3. number and types of services available

    for people outside the organization, to give them secure and safe access.
    
** [1.5] Internet connections

*** [1.5.1] Internet access technologies
    how do you actually connect users and organizations to the internet?

    home users, remote workers, and small offices require a connection to an ISP. The following are the popular choices:
    - broadband cable
    - broadband digital subscriber line (DSL)
    - wireless WANs
    - mobile services

    Popular choices for businesses or organization (faster business-class interconnections):
