* chapter 3: Protocols

** Why study protocols?
    - they are the rules enforced upon networks that govern how information will be relayed.

** [3.1] The Rules
    - Computer networks use rules to communicate
*** [3.1.2] Communications fundamentals
    - Message source (sender)
      + people or electronic devices that need to send a message to other individuals to other individuals or devices
    - message destination (receiver)
      + receives the message and interprets it
    - Channel
      + consists of the media that provide the pathway over which the message travel from source destination
*** [3.1.3] Communication protocols
    - protocols
      + govern communication over a network
    - two people can communicate through:
      + message source -> tranmitter -> transmission medion -> receiver -> message destination
      + message -> signal -> _________ -> signal -> message
    - before communication, the 'how' to communicate must be agreed upon
      + then, decide the format in which the message will be transmitted
*** [3.1.4] Rule establishment
    - rules that govern the conversation: protocols
    - protocols must account for the following requirements to successfully deliver a message that is understood by the receiver
      + indentified sender and receiver
      + common language and grammar
      + speed and timing of delivery
      + confrmation or acknowledgement requirement
*** [3.1.5] Network protocol requirements
    - in addition to indentifying source and destinatio, computer network protocols also define the details of how a message is transmitted across a network.
    - network protocols include the following requirements like:
      + message encoding
      + message formatting and encapsulation
      + message size
      + message timing
      + message delivery options
*** [3.1.6] Message encoding
    - encoding is the process of converting indormation into another acceptable form (for transmission)
    - decoding is th reverse process (done to interpret the information)
    - encoding between hosts must be in an appropriate format for the medium
    - messages sent are converted to bits by the sending host then encoded into a pattern of voltages on copper wires, infared lights in optical fibers, or microwaves for wireless systems. Then the destination host receives and decodes the signals to interpret the message
    - Example:
      + message source -> encoder -> transmitter -> transmission media -> receiver -> decoder -> message destination
*** [3.1.7] Message formatting and encapsulation                     
    - encapsulation
      + way of restricting the access to data (putting it inside the envelope)
    - formatting
      + presenting the messages in a standard and acceptable way, specifies information like sender info and recepient info
    - a message must use a specific format or structure
    - formats depend on the type of message and the channel that is used to deliver the message
      + IP is a protocol with similar function to an envelope. It is responsible for sending a message from the source to destination over one or more networks
*** [3.1.8] Message size
    - (in f2f communication) sentences are limited in size, relative to what a person can process at one time
    - (in networks) messages are broken into indivdual pieces that meet both the minimum and maximum size requirements
      + frames
	+ rules that govern the size of the pieces of data
	+ if messages are too short or too long, it is disregarded
	+ has its own addressing information
	+ how it goes: long messages will be sent in seperate frames (will contain original piece of the original message, has its own addressing info)-> reconstructed by the receiving host into the original message
*** [3.1.9] Message timing
    - message timing includes the following
      + flow control
	- process of managing the rate of data transmission
      + response timeout
	- how long to wait for responses and specify appropriate actions to take if response timeouts occur
      + access method
	- collision of information, what to do in such situations
	- to determine whether a line is available
	  + full-duplex
	    - 2 way
	  + half-duplex
	    - 1 way
*** [3.1.10] Message delivery options
    - messages can be delivered in different ways
      + unicast - deliver one-to-one
      + multicast - deliver to multiple people but not all
      + broadcast - deliver to all

** [3.2] Protocols
    - will give an overview of networks
*** Network protocol overview
    - network protocols
      + a common format and set of rules for exchanging data between devices
      + implemented by end devices and intermediary devices in software, hardware, or both
      + each protocol has its own functin, format and rules for communication
    - protocols that are needed to enable communications across one or more networks

*** [3.2.2] Network protocol functions
**** Network communication protocol
    - resposible for functions necessary for network communications betweek end devices
    - e.g. use of IPv4 to allow devices to understand where to send and where the messge came from

*** [3.2.3] Protocol interaction
    - messages sent over a network typically requires several protocols
    [[./media/web-req.png]]
    - in sending a requiest to a web server for a webpage includes the following protocols:
      + HTTP (hypert text transfer protocol)
	- governs the way the webserver communicates with the web client
	- defines the content and formtting of the requests and responses to be exchanged
	- both the web server and the client implement the protocol
	- HTTP relies on other protocols to gover how the messages are transported between the web server and client
      + TCP (Transmission control protocol)
	- manages the individual conversations
	- responsible for reliable delivery of the information and managing flow control between end devices
      + IP (internet protocol)
	- responsible for delivering messages from sender to the receiver
	- used by routers to forward messages across multiple networks
      + Ethernet
	- responsible for the delivery of messages from one NIC to another NIC on the same Ethernet LAN

** [3.3] Protocol suites

*** [3.3.1] Network protocol suites
    - protocol suites
      + are designed to work with each other seamlessly
      + tldr: protocols that work together (efficiently)
      + groups of inter-related protocols necessary to perform a communication function
    - we can think of protocol suites as a stack
      - lower levels are concerned with moving data over the network and providing services to the upper layers

*** [3.3.2] Evolution of protocol suites
    - [[./media/protocol-suites.png]]
    - during the evolution of network communications and the internet, there were several competing suites;
      + TCP/IP (internet protocol suite)
	- most common and relevant protocol today
	- open standard protocol maintained by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)

      + OSI (open systems interconnection) protocols
	- family of protocols developed jointly in 1977 (international organization for standardization (ISO) and international telecommunications union(ITU))
	- included the OSI model
	  - 7 layer reference model
	- mainly known today for its layed model
	- have been largely replaced by the internet protocol suite
	  
      + Apple talk
	- short-lived proprietary protocol suite released by apple Inc (1985)
	- apple eventuall adapted TCP/IP

      + Novell Netware
	- short-lived proprietary protocol suite and network operating system developed by Novell Inc (1983)
	- used the IPX network protocol
	- eventually (1995) adapted TCP/IP

*** [3.3.3] TCP/IP protocol example
    [[./media/TCPIP.png]] 
    - TCP/IP protocols are available for the following layers:
      + application
      + transport
      + internet
    - it is not used in the ACCESS LAYER
      + access layers are: LAN, WLAN
      + it is responsible for delibering the IP packet over the physical medium
    -
