* Chapter 2: Basic switch and end device configuration
** [2.1] Cisco IOS access
*** [2.1.1] Operating systems
    - all end to end and network devices require an OS
    - kernel - part of the OS that directly interacts with the hardware
    - shell - portion that interfaces with applications and the user 

    |----------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | shell    | allows users to make specific requests to the kernel                       |
    |          | made through cli or GUI                                                    |
    | kernel   | communicates between hardware and software                                 |
    |          | manages how hardware resources are used to meet the software  requirements |
    | hardware | physical part of the computer                                              |
    |----------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------|

*** [2.1.2] GUI
    an environment of graphical icons
    requires less knowledge of the underlying command structure that governs the OS
    does not provide all the capabilities of the CLI

    *OPERATING SYSTEMS ON ROUTERS ARE COMMONLY CALLED AS FIRMWARE

*** [2.1.3] Purpose of an OS
    Cisco devices run on Cisco IOS

*** [2.1.4] Access methods
    |--------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | Method             | Description                                                                                     |
    |--------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | Console            | Physical management port that provides out-of-band access to a Cisco device                     |
    |                    | requires dedicated software emulation tool and special cable                                    |
    |                    | device is configurable even if there are no networking devices configured (for initial configs) |
    |                    |                                                                                                 |
    | Secure Shell (SSH) | recommended for making remote CLI connections                                                   |
    |                    |                                                                                                 |
    | Telnet             | insecure SSH, does not encrypt                                                                  |
    |--------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    * some devices may have an AUXILIARY PORT. There are used to establish remote connections over a telephone connection using a modem. Somewhat similar to console connection since it is out of band and does not require any networking device to be configured or available.
    * out-of-band - means dedicated channel for device maintenance purposes only

*** [2.1.5] Terminal Emulation Programs
    Putty, TeraTerm, SecureCRT

** [2.2] IOS Navigation
*** [2.2.1] Primary Command Modes
    Cisco IOS software seperates management access into two command modes:
        1. User EXEC mode 
            with the symbol ">"
            cannot change the configuration of the device in this mode but can execute basic monitoring commands
        2. Priveleged EXEC mode 
            with the symbol "*"
            can execute configuration commands to the device
            higher configuration modes can only be accessed through this mode

*** [2.2.2] Configuration mode and subconfiguration modes
    To configure a device, a user must enter the GLOBAL CONFIGURATION MODE (global config mode)
    identified by a prompt ending in (config)*
    
    From the global config mode, the user can enter different subconfigs.
    two common subconfig modes:
    |------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------+----------------|
    | subconfig mode               | desc                                                       | prompt         |
    |------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------+----------------|
    | line configuration mode      | Used to configure console, ssh, telnet, or AUX connections | (config-line)* |
    | Interface configuration mode | used to configure a switch port or router netwok interface | (config-if)*   |
    |------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------+----------------|

*** [2.2.4] Navigate between IOS modes
    |--------------------+-----------------------------------|
    | command            | for what                          |
    |--------------------+-----------------------------------|
    | enable             | to enter Privileged exec mode     |
    | disable            | to exit Privileged exec mode      |
    | configure terminal | to go into global config mode     |
    | exit               | to exit global config mode        |
    | exit               | also to exit any sub config modes |
    | line ___ __        | to enter line config mode         |
    | interface ___ __   | to enter interface config mode    |
    |--------------------+-----------------------------------|


** [2.3] The Command Stucture
*** [2.3.1] basic IOS command structure
    tldr: Keyword + argument = command

    Keyword
        - a keyword defined by the OS
	- predefined
    Argument
        - a keyword defined by the user
	- defined by the user
*** [2.3.2] IOS command syntax check
    typixal unix-like stufff..... with emacs bindings !!! >:(
*** [2.3.3] IOS help features
    - use the symbol "?" for help 
     
** [2.4] Basic device configuration
*** [2.4.1] Device names
    - syntax:
      #+begin_src terminal
	hostname NAME
      #+end_src
      

*** [2.4.2] setting password 
****  password guidelines
     - Use passwords that are more than eight characters in length.
     - Use a combination of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, special characters, and/or numeric sequences.
     - Avoid using the same password for all devices.
     - Do not use common words because they are easily guessed.
*** [2.4.3] configuring passoword
    - syntax:
      + configuring the console port
	#+begin src terminal
	# conf t
	(config)# line console 0
	(config-line)# password PASSWORDHERE
	(config-line)# login
	(config-line)# end
	#+end_src
      + configuring the password for privileged exec mode
	#+begin_src  cisco
	  # conf t
	  (config)# enable secret PASSWORDHERE
	  (config)# exit
	#+end_src
      + to secure vtys (virtual terminals)
	#+begin_src cisco
	(config)# line vty 0 15
	(config-line)# password PASSWORDHERE
	(config-line)# login
	(config-line)# end
	#end_src
**** securing access methods
	- console, ssh, telnet - can set passwords for here through - password {actual password}
        - for SSH - more secure in internet
	  + 0 15 switches - 15 is number of possible conenctions
	  + 0 4  routers - 4 is number of possible connections
        - for telnet - are allowed both in internet and local internets
        can also set password in modes through -> enable secret 
*** [2.4.4] Encrypting passwords
    - encrypt password on the running config (not included the passwords sent over the network)
	#+begin_src bash
        (config)# service password-encryption
	#+end_src

*** [2.4.5] showing banner messages
    - to warn unauthorized access
    - to declare that only authorized personnel should access the device
    - syntax:
      #+begin_src cisco
	(config)# banner motd "BANNER HERE"
      #+end_src
    
    motd - message of the day 

    #+begin_src bash
    banner motd "BANNER HERE"
    #+end_src

** [2.5] Save configurations

*** [2.5.1] Configuration files
    - there are two system files that save device configuration
      + startup-configuration
	- stored configuration, saved in NVRAM
	- contains instructions that will be carried by the device upon startup, boot, or reboot
	- does not lose its content when the device is turned off
	  
      + running-configuration
	- Stored in RAM (random access memory)
	- reflects current device configuration
	- modifying this file will immediately affect the device

    - to see configuration files, use the following commands:
      #+begin_src cisco
	# show {startup-config|running-config}
      #+end_src

    - to save the running-config use the following command:
      #+begin_src cisco
	# copy running-config startup-config 
      #+end_src

*** [2.5.2] Alter the running configuration
    - the "reload" command
      + if the running configuration is configured in an undesirable manner, the "reload" command can be used to go back to the last saved startup-config
      + will cause downtime for the network
    - the "erase startup-config" command (have to reload to take effect)
      + will delete the startup config
      + useable when a startup config is messed up
    
*** [2.5.4] Capturing the configuration to a text file
    - needs a puTTy sht

** [2.6] Ports and addresses
*** [2.6.1] Ports and addresses
    - IP Addresses
	- primarily used to enable devices to locate one another
    - IPv4
	- dotted decimal notation
	- represented by four numbers (between 0 and 255) seperated by a period
	- assigned to individual devices in a network
    - IPv4 subnet mask
	- is a 32-bit value that differentials the network portion of the address from the hosts portion
	- together the IPv4, the subnet mask determines which subnet a device is a member
    - IPv6
	- more recent version of IPv4
	- is replacing the more common IPv4
	- are 128 bits in length and written as a string HEXADECIMAL values
	- represented by 4 single HEXADECIMAL digit (total of 32)
	- seperated by a colon, not case-sensitive
	- Ex. 2001:db8:acad:10::10
*** [2.6.2] Interfaces and ports
    - (network interface is a point of intersecrion between a computer and a network)
    - A cable connecting to the interface must adhere to match the physical standards of the interface
    - SVIs (switch virtual interfaces)
      + a virtualized interphase because of the lack of physical hardware on the device associated with an interface
