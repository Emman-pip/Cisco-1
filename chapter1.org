    basics of networking

** [1.1] Networks connect us 
    - Computer networking, including the internet, has impacted how the world works. 
    - Individual lifestyles are even affected.
    - Physical limitations became less irrelevant.
    
*** [1.1.2]
    - Cisco is founded in 1997
    - Other cisco sht... (including ads)

** [1.2] Network Components
*** [1.2.1] Host Roles
    - Global communities are tied by the internet.
    - A computer must first be connected to the internet inorder to participate.
    
    - Hosts
      + all computers that are connected to a network and participate directly in network communication
      + can also be called 'end devices'
      + some hosts are 'clients'
      + specifically refers to devices on the network that are ASSIGNED A NUMBER for communication purposes.
	  - The number identifies the host within a network
	  - the number is called the Internet Protocol (IP) address

    - IP Address
	- Identifies the host and the network to which the host is attached

    - Servers
	- are COMPUTERS WITH SOFTWARE that ALLOW THEM TO PROVIDE INFORMATION
	  - Ex. of server software:
	     web server
	     database server

    - Clients
	- have software for requesting and displaying information obtained from the server
	  - Ex . of client software
	    Web Browser

****  Types of server software:

      | Type  | Description                                                                                                                                  |
      |-------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
      | Email | runs email server software (microsoft outlook, etx). Used to access email on the server.                                                     |
      | Web   | runs web server software. Used to Access the webpages on the server                                                                          |
      | File  | stores corporate and user files in a central location. Client devices access these files using file explorers such as Windows' File Explorer |

      |--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
      | All servers are hosts, but not all hosts are servers (same with clients) |
      |--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
      | There are three types of server software: Email, Web, File               |
      |--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
      | All server software has a (or multiple) pairing client software          |
      |--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
      | Client and server network requires seperate computers for each           |
      |--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
	  
*** [1.2.2] Peer-to-Peer
    - Peer-to-peer network is used in small businesses an homes.
    - Computers function as SERVERS AND CLIENTS on the network.

    | Advantages of peer-to-peer networking                                  |
    |------------------------------------------------------------------------|

    | lower costs since no dedicated servers are required                    |
    | can be used for simple tasks (transferring files and sharing printeres |
    |------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    
    | Disadvantages of peer-to-peer networking                                                       |
    |------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | No centralized administration (no servers to mingle with if you want to control the data etc.) |
    | Not as secure *any computer in the network can access or pretend to be a server                |
    | not scalable                                                                                   |
    | multiple roles in devices may hinder their performance                                         |
    |------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

*** [1.2.3] End Devices
    - To distiguish one device from another, end devices are given unique addresses.
    - When a device initiates communication, it uses the address of the devices to deliver the message.

*** [1.2.4] Intermediary Devices
    - connect the individual end devices to the network.
    - they can connect multiple networks together to create an internetwork.
    - provides connectivity and ensure that data flows across the network.
    - these devices use the device addresses and the information about the internetwork to determine the path the message will take.

** [1.3] Network Representations and Topologies

*** [1.3.1] Network Representations
    (TOPOLOGY diagram)
    - are used to represent networks: the components, what the network looks like, where are specific components located.
    - provides a way to easily understand how devices connect to a large network

    
**** Additional terminology
    NIC (network interface card)
    - physically connects the end device to the network

    Physical port
    - where the network media connects
    - a connector or outlet

    Interface
    - specialized ports that connect to individual networks
    - because routers connect networks, its ports are called network interfaces.

*** [1.3.2] Topology diagrams
    - mandatory diagrams for networks
    - a visual map of how networks are connected
    - There are two types of diagrams: physical and logical.


    Physical topology diagrams
    - illustrate the physical location of intermediary devices and cable installation

    Logical topology diagrams
    - illustrate the devices, ports, and the addressing scheme of the network.
    - shows which devices are connected to intermediary devices and what network media is used

** [1.6] Reliable networks

*** [1.6.1] Network architecture
    - this term refers to, in some context, to the technologies that support the infrastuctures and the programmed services and rules, or protocols, that move the data across the network

**** 4 basic characteristics to meet user expectation when it comes to network tolerance
    1. Fault tolerance
    2. Scalability
    3. Quality of service (QoS)
       + remember that QoS always pertains to the precedence of the data transfer type to be processed first
    4. Security

*** [1.6.2] Fault tolerance
    what is a fault tolerant network?

    - a network that minimizes data loss during transit
    - limits the affected devices when devices fail
    - allows quick recovery of data/routes
    - has *redundancy* (multiple paths between source and destination to help when one path fails)

    - *packet switching*
      + splits traffic into packets that are routed over a shared network
      + allows redundancy

*** [1.6.3] Scalability
    what is a scalable network?
    - a network that is able to quickly expand to support new users and applications(without degrading performace)
    - designers accept standards and protocols
    
    
*** [1.6.4] QoS (quality of service)
    an increasing requirement of today

    - *congestion*
      + when the demand for the bandwidth exceeds the amount available
      + when congestion happens, the devices will hold the packets until it is able to be transmitted to its destination
      + webpages are usually low in priority, while voice over IP is high priority

    
*** [1.6.5] Network security
    network infrastucture security and information security
