* Chapter 2: Basic switch and end device configuration
** [2.1] Cisco IOS access
*** [2.1.1] Operating systems
    - all end to end and network devices require an OS
    - kernel - part of the OS that directly interacts with the hardware
    - shell - portion that interfaces with applications and the user 

    |----------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | shell    | allows users to make specific requests to the kernel                       |
    |          | made through cli or GUI                                                    |
    | kernel   | communicates between hardware and software                                 |
    |          | manages how hardware resources are used to meet the software  requirements |
    | hardware | physical part of the computer                                              |
    |----------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------|

*** [2.1.2] GUI
    an environment of graphical icons
    requires less knowledge of the underlying command structure that governs the OS
    does not provide all the capabilities of the CLI

    *OPERATING SYSTEMS ON ROUTERS ARE COMMONLY CALLED AS FIRMWARE

*** [2.1.3] Purpose of an OS
    Cisco devices run on Cisco IOS

*** [2.1.4] Access methods
    |--------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | Method             | Description                                                                                     |
    |--------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | Console            | Physical management port that provides out-of-band access to a Cisco device                     |
    |                    | requires dedicated software emulation tool and special cable                                    |
    |                    | device is configurable even if there are no networking devices configured (for initial configs) |
    |                    |                                                                                                 |
    | Secure Shell (SSH) | recommended for making remote CLI connections                                                   |
    |                    |                                                                                                 |
    | Telnet             | insecure SSH, does not encrypt                                                                  |
    |--------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    * some devices may have an AUXILIARY PORT. There are used to establish remote connections over a telephone connection using a modem. Somewhat similar to console connection since it is out of band and does not require any networking device to be configured or available.
    * out-of-band - means dedicated channel for device maintenance purposes only

*** [2.1.5] Terminal Emulation Programs
    Putty, TeraTerm, SecureCRT

** [2.2] IOS Navigation
*** [2.2.1] Primary Command Modes
    Cisco IOS software seperates management access into two command modes:
        1. User EXEC mode 
            with the symbol ">"
            cannot change the configuration of the device in this mode but can execute basic monitoring commands
        2. Priveleged EXEC mode 
            with the symbol "*"
            can execute configuration commands to the device
            higher configuration modes can only be accessed through this mode

*** [2.2.2] Configuration mode and subconfiguration modes
    To configure a device, a user must enter the GLOBAL CONFIGURATION MODE (global config mode)
    identified by a prompt ending in (config)*
    
    From the global config mode, the user can enter different subconfigs.
    two common subconfig modes:
    |------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------+----------------|
    | subconfig mode               | desc                                                       | prompt         |
    |------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------+----------------|
    | line configuration mode      | Used to configure console, ssh, telnet, or AUX connections | (config-line)* |
    | Interface configuration mode | used to configure a switch port or router netwok interface | (config-if)*   |
    |------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------+----------------|

*** [2.2.4] Navigate between IOS modes
    |--------------------+-----------------------------------|
    | command            | for what                          |
    |--------------------+-----------------------------------|
    | enable             | to enter Privileged exec mode     |
    | disable            | to exit Privileged exec mode      |
    | configure terminal | to go into global config mode     |
    | exit               | to exit global config mode        |
    | exit               | also to exit any sub config modes |
    | line ___ __        | to enter line config mode         |
    | interface ___ __   | to enter interface config mode    |
    |--------------------+-----------------------------------|


** [2.3] The Command Stucture
*** [2.3.1] basic IOS command structure
    tldr: Keyword + argument = command

    Keyword
        - a keyword defined by the OS
    Argument
        - a keyword defined by the user

*** [2.3.2] IOS command syntax check
    typixal unix-like stufff..... with emacs bindings !!! >:(
    
** Device names
    Start with a letter
    contain no spaces
    end with digit or numnr

    name with hostname command

*** setting password 
****  password guidelines
        more than 8 charaters
        use uppercase and lowercase letter
        avoid using the same password for all devices
        combination with symbols and sht

**** securing access methods
        console, ssh, telnet - can set passwords for here through - password {actual password}
        - for SSH - more secure in internet

        0 15 switches - 15 is number of possible conenctions 
        0 4  routers - 4 is number of possible connections
        
        - for telnet - are allowed both in internet and local internets
        can also set password in modes through - enable secret 
        
**** Encrypting passwords
	#+begin_src bash
        service password-encryption
        encrypts password
	#+end_src

*** showing banner messages
    to warn unauthorized access
    motd - message of the day 

    #+begin_src bash
    banner motd "BANNER HERE"
    #+end_src
