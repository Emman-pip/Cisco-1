* Chapter 4: Physical Layer
First layer of the OSI model
** [4.1.1]The physical connection 
   physical connections are estalished first
    - wired network
      + a network where data is transmitted through a physical cable
    - Wireless connectivity
      + data is transmitted using radio waves
      + devices connect to a wireless access point(AP) or wireless router
*** Wireless router
    components of a wireless router
    [[./media/router.png]]
    1. wireless antennas
    2. several ethernet switchports
    3. internet port

*** Network Interface Cards (NIC)
    - connect a device to the network
    - one device could have multiple NICs
    - ethernet NICs
      + used for wired connections
    - wireless local area network (WLAN) NICs
      + used for wireless connections
 
** [4.2] The Physical Layer Characteristics
*** [4.2.1] The Physical Layer
    - transports bits that make up data link frame across the network media
    - upper layers of the OSI layers - designed by software engineers and computer scientists
    - services and protocols in the TCP/IP suite - defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)
    [[./media/governing.png]]
    - governing bodies
      + International organization for standardization (ISO)
      + telecommunications industry association /electronic industries association (TIA/EIA)
      + International telecommunication union (ITU)
      + americal national standards institute (ANSI)
      + Institure of Electrical and Electronics Engineeers
      + National telecommunications regulatory authorities including the federal communication commission (FCC) in the USE and Eutopean Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI)
*** [4.2.2] Physical components
    the physical later standards address three functional areas:
    - physical components
      + the electronic hardware devices, media, and other connectors that transmit the signals that represent the bits (e.g. NICs, interfaces, connectors, cable materials)
    - encoding
    - signaling

*** [4.2.3] Encoding
    - method of converting a stram of data bits into a predefined code
    - code
      + grouping of bits used to provide a predictable pattern that can be recognized by both the sender and the receiver
    - encoding is the method or pattern used to represent digital information

*** [4.2.4]signaling
    - way that bits are represented (the electrical, optical, and wireless signal that represent 1 and 0)

*** [4.2.5] Bandwidth
    - capacity at which a medium can carry data
    - digital bandwidth
      + measures the amount of data that can flow from one place to another in a given amount of time
    - measures in kbps, Mbps, Gbps
    - factors that determines practical bandwidth of a network
      + properties of the physical media
      + technologies chosen for signaling and detecting network signals
    [[./media/bandwidth.png]]
*** [4.2.6] terms used to measure the quality of bandwidth
    - latency
      + amount of time, including delays, for data to travel from one given point to another
    - throughput
      + measure of the transfer of bits across the media over a given period of time
      + usually does not match the specified bandwidth in the physical layer inplementation (usually lower than the bandwidth)
      + influenced by (1) the amount of traffic, (2) the type of traffice, and (3) the latency created by the number of network devices encountered between source and destination
    - goodput
      + measurement to assess the transfer of usable data transferred over a given period of time
      + throuput - traffic overhead
      + always lower than the through put

** [4.3] Copper cabling
Oldest and most used media for communications
*** [4.3.1]Characteristics of copper cabling
    - Data is transferred through electrical pulses
    - signal deteriorates the farther it travels
**** Timing and voltage values of electrical pulses are susceptible to the interference from two sources:
    1. Electromagnetic interference (EMI) or radio frequency interferencd (RFI)
       - can distort or corrupt data signals being carried by a copper media
       - potential sources of EMI and RFI include radio waves, electromagnetic devices
    2. Crosstalk
       - is s disturbance caused by the elctric or magnetic fields of a signal on one wire to the signal in an adjacent wire
       - magnetic fields formed influce each other
**** to counter such interferences
    1. for EMI and RFI
       - use of metallic shoulding and proper grounding connections
    2. for crosstalk
       - twisted pairs of wires which effectively cancels the crosstalk

*** [4.3.2] types of copper cabling
    - Unshielded twisted pair (UTP)
      - most common networking media
      - color coded
    - Shielded twisted pair (STP
      + better noise protection but more expensive and difficult to install
    - Coaxial cable)
      + coax for short
      + gets its name from the fact that there are two conductors that share the same axis
      + commonly used in wireless installations and cable internet installation

** [4.4] UTP Cabling

*** [4.4.1] Properties of UTP Cabling
    - cancellation
      + designers pair wires so that they are the exact opposite of one another
      + this results in the two magnetic fields cancelling each other and also calcel out anu outside EMI and RFI signals
    - varying the number of twists per wire pair
      + different number of twists per twisted pair
      + this enhances the cancellation effect

*** [4.4.2] UTP Cabling Standards
    - conforms to the standards established by the TIA/EIA
    - categorized according to its performance (bandwidth)
    - 5e is now the minimal acceptable cable type, with cat6 being the recommended type for new building installations
